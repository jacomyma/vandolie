<h2 id="1-how-to-create-a-corpus-dataset">1. How to create a corpus (dataset)</h2>
<p>This tool will analyze a corpus (a dataset) of text documents.
Each document is simply a bit of text that you found on the web (or elsewhere).
It can be as short as a sentence, or as long as a newspaper article.
But it has to be just text (no images or other media).</p>
<p>First, let‚Äôs see how it works, then we will see where to find documents and how to select them.</p>
<h4 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started</h4>
<p>Click on ‚ÄúGet started‚Äù in the menu to load the ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù page.</p>
<p><strong>If you just want to see the tool in action</strong>, load an example from the menu at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/dataset-load-example.png" alt="Add document">
<p><strong>If you want to make your own corpus</strong>, then click on ‚ÄúAdd document‚Äù to start editing your first document.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/dataset-add-doc.png" alt="Add document">
<p>This will open an interface to edit your first document.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/dataset-doc-empty.png" alt="Empty document">
<p>A document consists of three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>A title</li>
<li>Textual content</li>
<li>A category</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="how-to-fill-a-document">How to fill a document</h4>
<p>Let‚Äôs assume that you have a source of information, like a Wikipedia page, to use as a document.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First, give a title.</strong> You can invent it, or reuse your source‚Äôs title (if it has one). It is just a way to identify your document easily. Type it in the top field of the interface.</li>
<li><strong>Second, copy-paste the textual content of your source</strong> into the middle field of the interface.</li>
<li><strong>Third, type a category</strong> in the bottom field. <em>Be consistent in your spelling, or else each different spelling will count as a different category.</em> We explain how to decide categories down below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have filled all three parts, you can save your document by clicking on the ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button. <em>Note that you cannot save your document if it is not complete.</em></p>
<h4 id="how-to-manage-the-dataset">How to manage the dataset</h4>
<p>You can create as many documents as you want.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-1000" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/dataset-saved-docs.png" alt="3 documents">
<p>We think you need at least 10 documents, but 20 is a better number. You could go up to 50, or more if your computer is powerful enough (it will take more time to compute).</p>
<p><strong>Click on a saved to enter edit mode again.</strong> You can change it, or even delete it. Remember to save (or cancel) your changes.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-1000" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/dataset-saved-docs-edit.png" alt="3 documents with one in edit mode">
<p>You can <strong>save your dataset</strong> by clicking on the ‚ÄúSave (CSV)‚Äù button. You will be able to upload it later on, or share it with other people.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/dataset-save-csv.png" alt="Save CSV">
<p><strong>Once your corpus is ready, click on one of the three algorithms available</strong> just below your set of documents. They do different things. You can try them all. You will be able to come back to your documents and edit them if you want.</p>

</a><a id="method-help">
<h3 id="where-to-find-documents-and-how-to-decide-categories">Where to find documents and how to decide categories?</h3>
<p>First of all, you can just try the tool and experiment with it to understand why categories matter. Feel free to <strong>experiment</strong>.</p>
<p>That being said, you will obtain the best results at three conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find <strong>documents</strong> that <strong>naturally separate</strong> into two parts, like water and oil.</li>
<li>Pick <strong>categories</strong> that <strong>reflect</strong> these two parts.</li>
<li>It should <strong>not</strong> be completely <strong>obvious</strong> that the two groups are well separated.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you add two groups of documents that are completely different, for instance articles about cheese and articles about sailing, they will separate but that is not interesting because we know for sure that they will. Maybe that would be interesting if they did <em>not</em> separate.</p>
<p>The <strong>good documents and categories</strong> should always be <strong>a little bit surprising.</strong> If you add two groups of documents where it is hard to know if they will be the same or not, then it is interesting. It provides a new information, because we did not know. You will find examples below.</p>
<p>The documents and the categories go together. Select them to make an interesting <strong>comparison</strong>. Think of them as a way to ask question such as: ‚ÄúDo you think that documents A and documents B are similar or different?‚Äù And of course, that question is interesting if it does not have an obvious answer. The algorithms will allow you to find and answer to the question you ask.</p>
<p>You could <strong>compare how we talk of two similar things</strong>. For example, you could compare how we talk about two religions, or men and women, or two nationalities, etc. That could be a way to look into discrimination. For instance, you could compare Wikipedia articles about male pop artists with Wikipedia articles about female pop artists. This would ask the question: ‚ÄúAre Wikipedia articles about male and female pop artists different or the same?‚Äù The answer is not obvious because, on the one hand, they are all pop artists, but on the other hand, they are men and women. So it is an interesting thing to look at.</p>
<p>You could also <strong>compare how two different media write about the same thing</strong>. You could compare how left-wing newspapers and right-wing newspapers write about the same subject, for instance immigration, the European Union, or nuclear energy. Or you could compare how a same topic is discussed on social media (Reddit, Facebook‚Ä¶) versus on mainstream media (newspapers, TV channels‚Ä¶). Or you could compare local press and national press, or the local press in one region and in another region, etc.</p>
<p>There are yet other ways to make interesting comparisons, like old articles versus new articles (ex: before and after Covid), science versus popular culture, etc. Be creative!</p>
<p>The important is to pick documents that have the difference you aim to compare, but no other difference. If you compare documents from two media, keep a same topic; conversely, if you compare two topics, pick documents from the same media or similar ones.</p>
<p>In this tool, <strong>a document can be any text</strong>. Don‚Äôt be afraid to copy-paste texts that don‚Äôt look like traditional documents, for example discussions on social media. Not every document has to look serious and official. It depends on what you want to compare. What normal people say over the internet also counts as a information worth analyzing.</p>
</a><p><a id="method-help">You will find documents in many public websites: </a><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</a>, <a href="https://www.fandom.com/">Fandom</a>‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You can also use social media such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> (look at the comments), etc.</p>
<p>And via libraries, you can also have access to newspaper articles from many outlets. Those are normally behind a paywall, but libraries often provide a special free access to them. And sometimes, you can search them for free, for instance the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/search">BBC</a>.</p>

<a id="count">
<h2 id="2-how-to-use-count-the-words">2. How to use: Count the words</h2>
<p>This algorithm simply counts in how many documents a given word is mentioned. Note that it does not matter if the word appears once or multiple times in a same document.</p>
<p>Type any word in the search field (and hit Enter) to start the counting.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-search.png" alt="Search field">
<p>By default, this will not count the exact word, but any word that contains it. For example, ‚Äútrain‚Äù will also count ‚Äútrains‚Äù and ‚Äútraining‚Äù. If you do not want that, check the setting ‚ÄúExact word‚Äù.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-exact.png" alt="Exact word button">
<p>Alternatively, click on one of the <strong>top words</strong> to search for it. Those are defined as the 25 words appearing in the largest number of documents, stop words aside. The number in parentheses indicates in how many documents they appear.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-1000" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-topwords.png" alt="Top word buttons">
<p><em>Note: you can find other good words to analyze in ‚ÄúCo-word network‚Äù.</em></p>
<h3 id="word-counting-results">Word counting results</h3>
<p>Your search will show you the result of counting how many documents contain your word in two ways.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, a bar chart displaying the percentage of documents mentioning your query for each category. The bigger the bar for each category, the largest proportion of documents in that category mention the word you queried.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-barchart1.png" alt="Bar chart">
<p><em>Second</em>, details about where the word is mentioned in each document (if it is).</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-details.png" alt="Details about each document">
<p>Use those details to verify that your query works as intended.</p>
<h3 id="try-to-find-words-that-match-only-one-category">Try to find words that match only one category</h3>
<p>The interesting words are those appearing in only one of those categories, and not the other. These words characterize a specific category.</p>
<p>Here is an example with the dataset about male and female pop artists on Wikipedia, which is one of the sample datasets you can try.</p>
<p>The word ‚Äúhe‚Äù is only present in the descriptions of male artists‚Ä¶</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-barchart2.png" alt="Bar chart">
<p>‚Ä¶while the word ‚Äúshe‚Äù is (almost) only present in the descriptions of female artists.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-barchart3.png" alt="Bar chart">
<p><em>Note: this only works if you search for the <strong>exact word</strong>, since of course ‚Äúhe‚Äù is contained in ‚Äúshe‚Äù!</em></p>
<p>This example may be too obvious to be really interesting, but it shows you what it means, for a word, to be characteristic of a single category. The next examples, with the same dataset, might be more interesting.</p>
<p>The word ‚Äúband‚Äù is mostly associated with male artists. Perhaps more of them play in a band than female artists?</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-barchart4.png" alt="Bar chart">
<p>The word ‚Äúhighest-paid‚Äù is mostly associated with female artists. Perhaps the success of female artists is more often measured with money than the success of male artists?</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/count-barchart5.png" alt="Bar chart">
<p>This algorithm does not give you a definitive answer, but it helps asking interesting questions.</p>
<p>To find interesting words, use the next algorithm, ‚ÄúCo-word network‚Äù, and look for words colored strongly like one specific category.</p>
<!-- Do not translate this code -->
</a><a id="network">
<h2 id="3-how-to-use-co-word-network">3. How to use: Co-word network</h2>
<p>This algorithm makes a network of <strong>words connected when they appear in the same documents</strong>. Let‚Äôs look at the resulting network before returning to the settings.</p>
<p>If you have two very different kinds of documents, the network will have two distinct parts. In the example below, you have the words from BBC news articles about fishing (in blue) and about trains (in yellow). As fishing and trains have nothing in common, the network separates quite well.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-1.png" alt="Example network">
<p><em>Note: there is a word that connects the blue part to the yellow part. We call it a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù. It is one of the rare things the two kinds of documents have in common. In this case, it is the word ‚Äúfuture‚Äù.</em></p>
<p>If your documents are relatively similar, the network will not look like it has distinct parts. In the example below, you have the words from Wikipedia articles about male (blue) and female (yellow) pop artists. The articles are very similar, and most of the words are the same (‚Äúaward‚Äù, ‚Äúgrammy‚Äù, ‚Äúartist‚Äù‚Ä¶).</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-2.png" alt="Example network">
<p>Nevertheless, if you look closely, you will see that there is a more blue side (on the left) and a more yellow side (on the right). That is because there are still some differences even though the documents are very similar.</p>
<p>The network helps you <strong>find words</strong> that are <strong>specific to one category</strong>, and words that are connecting the categories (‚Äú<strong>bridges</strong>‚Äù).</p>
<p>You can reuse interesting words as queries in the ‚Äúcount the word‚Äù algorithm.</p>
<p>If your documents are very similar and it looks like your categories do not separate well, also try the third algorithm ‚Äúsemantic map‚Äù, as it is even better at finding differences. However, the semantic map visualizes documents, while this network visualizes words.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-network-settings">How to use network settings</h2>
<p>This algorithm is also just counting the words, except in a more fancy way than the ‚Äúcount the words‚Äù algorithms. Sometimes, there are different ways to count. That is why there are settings: you could decide to count one way or another. You can just try different settings and look at the results to explore the algorithm!</p>
<h4 id="settings-about-counting-word-occurrences">Settings about counting word occurrences</h4>
<p>The first step is simply about counting the words, essentially the same way as the first algorithm.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-includetitle.png" alt="Include title setting">
<p>Should the title be analyzed as part of the text, or not? If you have invented the title of your documents, then you should probably not use it as part of the text. But if the title was actually from the document, for instance with newspaper articles, then it‚Äôs a good idea to include it.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-howtocount.png" alt="How to count the words">
<p>How to count the words? We have two options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Count them <strong>once per document</strong>, not matter how many times they appear in that document.</li>
<li>Count <strong>how many times</strong> they appear <strong>in total</strong>, including when they appear multiple times in a same document.</li>
</ol>
<p>We think that the first option works better, but you can try the other one. It‚Äôs interesting to look at the effect it produces.</p>
<p>With the first option, the highest score is the number of documents in your dataset.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-count-1.png" alt="One count per word per document">
<p>With the second option, the highest score is much higher, as some words appear many times in a same document.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-count-2.png" alt="Multiple counts per word per document">
<p>As you can see by comparing the results, the words with the highest score are not the same.</p>
<h4 id="settings-about-removing-unnecessary-words">Settings about removing unnecessary words</h4>
<p>We call ‚Äústop words‚Äù the words of a language that we don‚Äôt find interesting. Those are the tool words we use to make sentences work, but that do not carry much meaning because they are everywhere, all the time. For example ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúof‚Äù, or ‚Äúand‚Äù.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-stopwords.png" alt="Stop words">
<p>The stop words are not the same in different languages. This tool has a stop words list for each language it supports. Use the list corresponding to the language of your documents.</p>
<p>The words with the highest count tend to be stop words, as you can see above. Which is why we want to remove them. Once stop words removed, the top words are more interesting:</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-remainingwords.png" alt="Remaining words">
<p>In addition to that, we also want to remove the words that do not appear often <em>enough</em>.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-threshold.png" alt="Remove words appearing too rarely">
<p>Use that setting to make your network bigger or smaller, which depends on how many documents you have, and how long they are.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we don‚Äôt need the network to be too big (slower to compute, more difficult to read). But on the other hand, if you keep words that appear less often, the network will be less interesting (because the separation pattern will be weaker). Try finding the best setting!</p>
<h4 id="co-occurrences">Co-occurrences</h4>
<p>Everytime two given words appear together in a document, we say they ‚Äúco-occur‚Äù. Therefore, the ‚Äúco-occurrence‚Äù score is counting how strongly two words are connected <em>in the dataset</em>.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-250" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-cooccurrences.png" alt="Co-occurrence list">
<p>There are no settings, as this calculation is straightforward. But it‚Äôs interesting to see which pairs co-occur the most. Those pairs will become the links of the network.</p>
<h4 id="settings-about-displaying-the-network">Settings about displaying the network</h4>
<p>The network visualization uses a layout algorithm to position the words in the picture so that they are close when they are connected (that is, when they co-occur). The goal is to make it visible when there are two or more groups of words (clusters) that match the categories. Two settings are used to improve the result, but you can disable them if you want.</p>
</a><p><a id="network">The <em>first improvement</em> is to <em>normalize</em> the co-occurrence scores by using a metric known as </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information">pointwise mutual information</a>. In short, it helps by taking into account that some of the words are mentioned more often, which makes them more likely to co-occur. On a practical level, it makes the network more readable.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-pmi.png" alt="Pointwise mutual information setting">
<p>The <em>second improvement</em> is to <em>remove the disconnected words</em>. Those are rare, but it may happen sometimes. They are distracting and are not very interesting, since they are not linked to any other word, so we can just remove them.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/network-setting-orphans.png" alt="Remove orphans setting">
<h2 id="how-to-read-the-co-word-network">How to read the co-word network</h2>
<p>Each dot is a word, colored according to categories. Each dot has a color blend corresponding to the categories of the documents where it is mentioned the most.</p>
<p>Each white line is a co-occurrence relation between the two connected words.</p>
<p>Two dots (words) that are connected (co-occur) tend to be placed closer through the effect of the layout algorithm <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098679">Force Atlas 2</a>. As a result, distinct visual groups, even if they are not completely disconnected, indicate <strong>topics</strong> (a topic being a group of words that tend to be mentioned together).</p>
<p><em>Note that <strong>the layout algorithm is ‚Äúnon-deterministic‚Äù</strong>: the result varies from one time to another because it requires a randomized initialization. Yet, as you can see if you try, <strong>the clusters (topics) are always the same</strong>. They can be rotated, flipped, or slightly changed, but they will always be the same, have the same size, etc.</em></p>
<p>You can move the network view by dragging with the cursor or your finger on a touch screen, and zoom in and out with the scroll wheel, pinch zoom, or equivalent supported by your device. Use it to explore the network and find interesting words.</p>

<a id="semantic">
<h2 id="4-how-to-use-semantic-map">4. How to use: Semantic map</h2>
<p>This algorithm is entirely automatic and requires no settings. It works in two parts.</p>
</a><p><a id="semantic">The <strong>first part</strong> consists of using a ‚Äú<strong>text embedding model</strong>‚Äù, and more precisely </a><a href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2">all-MiniLM-L6-v2</a>, which is multilingual (it ‚Äúspeaks‚Äù most languages). It transforms any text into a semantic representation. We will not explain how it works, but rather what it does.</p>
<p>This model uses AI to transform any text into a series of numbers. In mathematics, we say it gets ‚Äúembedded‚Äù into a ‚Äúvector‚Äù. Each vector is very long (hundreds of dimensions) and encodes the meaning of that text. On a practical level, these vectors have a very interesting property: <strong>similar texts produce similar vectors</strong>.</p>
<p>The distance between vectors encodes semantic similarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completely different documents produce very distant vectors</li>
<li>Documents about the same topic produce quite close vectors</li>
<li>Documents that mean the same thing but written differently have very close vectors</li>
<li>Almost-identical documents produce almost-overlapping vectors.</li>
</ul>
<p>We use this property to produce the semantic map.</p>
<p>The <strong>second part</strong> of the algorithm consists of visualizing the vector space as a map. This is called ‚Äú<strong>dimensionality reduction</strong>‚Äù because we reduce the very long vectors to two dimensions. In other words, we reduce them to points on a plane. To do this, we use a technique named <em>UMAP</em>. You can learn about it <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/">on this page</a>. In short, it produces a map that preserves the most important property: distance encodes semantic similarity.</p>
<p>The <strong>resulting semantic map</strong> can be read as such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each dot is a document from your dataset</li>
<li>The color of the document indicates its category</li>
<li>Dots (documents) are close when they have a similar content, and are far away when they have a different content.</li>
</ul>
<p>Like for the co-word network, this visualization is <em>non-deterministic</em>. Because of a random initialization of the algorithm, the result is a little bit different every time. However, the groups of dots or ‚Äúclusters‚Äù will always be the same. They will simply be flipped or rotated every time.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-interpret-the-semantic-map">How to interpret the semantic map</h2>
<p>Look at the semantic map and ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there <strong>distinct groups</strong> of dots (clusters)?</li>
<li>Are there <strong>distinct color groups</strong>?</li>
</ol>
<p>Those two question may look the same at first glance, but they are in fact two different and independent questions.</p>
<h4 id="are-there-distinct-clusters">Are there distinct clusters?</h4>
<p>By ‚Äúdistinct groups‚Äù, we mean groups of dots that are in different parts of the pictures. We can also call them ‚Äúclusters‚Äù. Each cluster consists of dots (documents) that are close to each other, while the clusters themselves are far away from each other.</p>
<p>In the example below, we have <strong>one single cluster</strong>. This means that all documents have a <strong>similar content</strong>.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/semantic-01.jpg" alt="One cluster">
<p>In the example below, we have <strong>two distinct clusters</strong>. This means that there are two groups of documents with different contents, probably <strong>two different topics</strong>.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/semantic-02.jpg" alt="Two cluster">
<p><em>Note that using different languages in the same dataset can also produce different clusters.</em></p>
<p><strong>The clusters are only about the text content of the documents, not the category.</strong> The clusters are identified by looking solely at the dot placement. Clusters are <em>independent</em> of the color. The placement does not take your categories into account. This point is very important, as we will see.</p>
<h4 id="are-there-distinct-color-groups">Are there distinct color groups?</h4>
<p>The second question you should ask is whether the colors are mixed, or grouped together.</p>
<p>If the colors are mixed, it means that your categories do not capture any semantic difference. In other words, documents of the same category are not particularly similar. It could look like this:</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/semantic-03.jpg" alt="One cluster mixed">
<p>If the colors form groups, it means that they capture some semantic similarity. It could look like this:</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/semantic-04.jpg" alt="One cluster color-polarized">
<p>In the example above, the documents are not <em>very</em> different, because they form one single cluster. Nevertheless, the cluster has two sides, which shows that there are semantic differences within the cluster. The categories still capture a small semantic difference.</p>
<p><strong>Very importantly, having clusters does not mean that your categories capture their semantic difference.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, it is possible to have <strong>two clusters</strong> (in terms of dot placements) yet have <strong>mixed colors</strong>. This will look like this:</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-500" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/semantic-05.jpg" alt="Two clusters mixed">
<p>The right thing to do, in this example, is to understand what the two groups are, and <em>redo the categories accordingly</em>. This way, you will be able to explain what makes the documents different.</p>
<p>When <strong>colors and clusters match</strong>, which may look like the example below, then the categories do capture the semantic differences between the documents.</p>

<h4 id="anomalies-and-nuances-in-the-map">Anomalies and nuances in the map</h4>
<p>Note that real-world datasets are not as well defined as the examples above. <em>That is even better!</em> Every time you see an anomaly, you have found something interesting to talk about. <em>Anomalies are relevant and valuable.</em></p>
<p>In the following example, we see two very well separated clusters, which are mostly color-coded, but there is one anomaly: there is a blue dot in the yellow dot (look on the right). Is it a mistake?</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/semantic-outlier1.png" alt="One outlier">
<p>This dataset contains BBC news about fishing (blue) and trains (yellow), which should have nothing to do with each other. In that sense, it‚Äôs not surprising that we have two very distinct clusters. But what is going on with the blue dot? We can zoom in and click on the dot to take a look at the document.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-1000" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/semantic-outlier2.png" alt="One outlier, zoomed in">
<p>This reveals something interesting: this article is not about real trains, but toy trains and, importantly, toy boats. This is why the embedding has considered that it was more similar to the news about fishing than to the other train-related news. That is an interesting find!</p>
<p>Also remark that, of all the documents of that cluster, the anomaly is the closest to the other cluster: that is not a coincidence.</p>
<p>If we look at another dataset, the male and female pop artists on Wikipedia, we see that the semantic map has two clusters but they are not very far apart. Of course, that is because the two categories have more in common (being pop artists) than fishing and trains.</p>
<img class="border vdl-pic pic-w-750" src="/vandolie/img/screenshots/en/semantic-nuanced.png" alt="Nuanced semantic map">
<p>It is not an issue that the two clusters are not completely separate. On the contrary, if we look at the details, we can identify the dots that are the most in-between or the most on the sides. For instance, Taylor Swift is the female artist who is the most similar to the male artists, and Adam Levine is the male artist most similar to female artists. Conversely, Cher is the most different from male artists and Billy Joel is the most different from female artists.</p>
<p>Once again, one cannot find a definitive interpretation for these nuances, but it begs intriguing questions. Semantic maps have a lot of interesting details to analyze.</p> </section> </div> </main>  <footer class="pt-5 pb-5"> <div class="container"> <div class="row justify-content-md-center"> <div class="col mb-2" style="min-width: 180px"> <a href="https://www.it-vest.dk/" target="_blank"> <div class="card p-3"> <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/vandolie/img/It-vest_UK_support.jpg"/><img class="footer-supported-by-img" src="/vandolie/img/It-vest_UK_support.jpg" alt="Supported by IT-Vest"/> </div> </a> </div> <div class="col mb-2" style="min-width: 180px"><p><em>Vandolie</em> is a free, open source tool developed by Mathieu Jacomy, Matilde Ficozzi, Cathrine Hofmann Fried, Jesper Wad Larsen, and <a class="link-info" href="https://www.ouestware.com/en/" target="_blank">Ouestware</a>.</p></div> <div class="col mb-2" style="min-width: 180px"> <ul> <li>License: <a class="link-info" href="https://github.com/jacomyma/vandolie/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank">GPL v3.0</a></li> <li>Clone our <a class="link-info" href="https://github.com/jacomyma/vandolie/" target="_blank">source code</a></li> <li>Give us your <a class="link-info" href="https://github.com/jacomyma/vandolie/issues" target="_blank">feedback</a></li> </ul> </div> <div class="col mb-2" style="min-width: 180px"> <a href="https://www.en.culture.aau.dk/research/research-groups/tantlab" target="_blank"> <img class="mb-3" src="/vandolie/img/tantlab_logo_white.svg" alt="Tantlab" style="max-height:24px"> </a> <br> <a href="https://www.ssh.aau.dk/forskning/signaturer/computationel-ssh-masshine" target="_blank"> <img src="/vandolie/img/Masshine_Logo_White.svg" alt="MASSHINE" style="max-height:24px"> </a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </main> </body></html>
