Group helps young people get into fishing industry,"A new Devon community interest company (CIC) is hoping to help with the future of the fishing industry by bringing in new recruits.

Devon Young Fishers aims to get young people aged between 11 and 25 years old interested in a career, with paid-for lessons for those who need them.

CEO Jemma Jewkes started the CIC after conversations with her partner Chris Roberts who runs a fishing charter. ""He and his fellow fishermen are always complaining that there is no youth coming into the industry,"" she said.

""We're trying to save the future of our fishing community by making it fun, inclusive and meaningful from an early age"".

Devon Young Fishers has three goals - teaching practical fishing and safety skills at sea, gaining mentorship and connections, and encouraging participants to explore career pathways in marine sustainability and conservation - meaning it is not just for those wanting to work in industrial fishing.

Evie, 16, who wants to be a marine biologist, said: ""Being out on the water and getting comfortable is really helpful, and also knowing the fish we catch.""

Jack, 14, was the first of the group's students and, because of the help, now wants to be a fisherman when he finishes school.

""It's good fun seeing what you catch, and it's hands-on. You are always doing something"", he said. 

However, in order to be able to take on more people and expand beyond Salcombe, the company needs more commercial fishers and charter skippers who are willing to take on students.

The team is also working to reduce the age on commercial vessels from 16 to 14 to enable more young people to safely come into the industry.

Ms Jewkes said: ""If we get the age lowered to 14, in line with child working regulations and with all proper risk assessments and health and safety, we can introduce more young people into fishing"".",Fishing
Fishing ban on park lake lifted with restrictions,"A fishing ban on a park lake in Lancashire has been lifted, but only within new designated areas.

Angling was suspended at Stanley Park lake in Blackpool on 1 September over fears birds were becoming entangled in tackle.

A public consultation was carried out between 31 March and 11 May and received more than 1,000 submissions.

After considering them, the council said it would work with the Friends of Stanley Park, the Angling Trust and the angling community to establish a Stanley Park Fishing Club, who will ultimately manage fishing on the lake. 

'Park used by many'

Fishing will be allowed within a ""clearly signposted"" designated area, the council said, which would ""help minimise the risk to wildlife and allow fishing activity to be managed more effectively"".

Nigel Patterson, chair of Friends of Stanley Park, said: ""The park is used by many people for many different purposes.

""We know it is a delicate balancing act ensuring that everyone can enjoy the park without impacting on others.

""We are pleased that the council has come to this conclusion and look forward to working with them to establish a formal fishing club.""",Fishing
Cygnet killed by discarded fishing tackle at pond,"A cygnet had to be put down after eating discarded fishing tackle at a pond where an angling ban is in place.

Despite efforts from volunteers and a vet, the bird had to be euthanised after it was found with a yellow tag hanging from its mouth at Hammond's Pond in Carlisle.

Wildlife rescue volunteer Kate Wakefield, who was called to the scene on Sunday, said it was a ""tragic outcome"", adding: ""It made me cry.""

Cumberland Council said the cygnet's death highlighted ""one of the key reasons"" for fishing not being allowed at the pond.

Ms Wakefield said the young bird was sedated and an x-ray showed the barb had gone right down the oesophagus with no way to remove it without causing ""extensive damage"".

""You've got to be really careful in case there's something at the end that will get damaged if you pull anything,"" she said.

The vet felt the only ""humane"" outcome would be to put the cygnet down while it was sedated, Ms Wakefield added.
'Unsuitable place for fishing'

She said the latest death was not an isolated incident.

Several swans and cygnets died after ingesting discarded tackle in 2023 and volunteers are called there every couple of weeks to help wildlife, she said.

Cumberland Council said it was ""dedicated to protecting the wildlife"" in all of its green spaces.

A spokesman said: ""We're currently working closely with onsite youth workers to help engage and educate young people about why Hammond's Pond isn't a suitable place for fishing.

""In the meantime, we carry out regular maintenance of the pond, including clearing litter and removing discarded fishing lines, to minimise the risk to wildlife.""",Fishing
Lifeline for future of village fishing industry,"The fishing industry in a Cornish village has been thrown a lifeline following the closure of Plymouth Fish Market.

Previously the Plymouth market operated a collection and auction service for fish landed at Polperro and other small ports in the area.

The port's only remaining trawler, the Rebecca V, has since been forced to take its catch to Plymouth for it to be transported by lorry to Brixham market.

But Polperro Harbour Trust has now bought its own refrigerated van so that fish landed in the village can instead be taken to a distribution depot in Roche.

Peter Hickey, the chairperson of the Polperro Harbour Trust, said the closure of the fish market in Plymouth meant the end of the collection service from the village.

""As a result some of our bigger vessels that used to land and had their fish picked up, had to drop off at other ports so we lost them altogether.

""The purchase of the van gives us the opportunity to get the larger vessels back in the harbour.""

Mr Hickey said the trust, which is now 130 years old, was established and funded by a small duty charged on fish landed at Polperro.

""It's our heritage, it's what the village is all about, so the trustees have been working quite hard to keep commercial fishing in the village and help keep it viable,"" he said.

""The fishing industry has been under a lot of pressure for years now with catches going down, and quotas and Brexit and all that.

""So it did feel like another nail in the coffin of commercial fishing, which is why we are pleased to turn that around with the purchase of the van.

""The catches are going up and we're putting more fuel through the fuel facilities in the harbour so everything we hoped for is working,"" said Mr Hickey.

The specialist van has been co-funded by the Marine Management Organisation but the trust said it would need to fundraise to keep it in service.

Polperro fisherman Chris Puckey said it would help preserve the village as a proper port.

""If we didn't have the van in five, ten years time we'd see all fancy white yachts in here and that's not what people come to see,"" he said.

""There's been hundreds of years fishing from Polperro, so it would be sad to see it go just because we couldn't transport fish."" ",Fishing
"Fishing boat with striking mural sinks in harbour ","A fishing boat painted with a striking mural, which became a tourist attraction in Plymouth, has sunk.

The vessel, which was built in 1961 and has been moored in Sutton Harbour for over a year, was illustrated with local attractions.

Plymouth artist Kevin Preston told BBC Radio Devon that he and the boat's owner, Neal Stoneman, were ""absolutely gutted"" and they hoped it could be recovered on Tuesday.

Footage and photos of the incident filmed by people in the Barbican area was widely shared on social media.

Mr Preston said the boat had become a local attraction, adding that some of his friends from as far afield as Scotland had travelled to see it while on holiday.

Illustrations painted on the vessel include the Hoe, Tinside Lido, Drake's Island, Mount Batten Pier, the coast of South East Cornwall, Plymouth Sound and Jennycliff Bay.

Neal Stoneman said he had received a phone call alerting him to the incident at around 20:45 BST on Friday.

He said by the time he got there he was told by the dock manager that ""there was nothing that could be done at that time"" and that he should come back on Saturday morning.

When asked what might have caused the boat to sink, he said he had ""no idea whatsoever because the boat's been there for 18 months now with not a problem"".

He said he hoped a team of divers could refloat the 26ft vessel and take it back to a boat storage facility in Plymouth on Tuesday. ",Fishing
Teen heads to US for fly fishing world championships,"A Dorset schoolgirl is part of a squad heading to the US to compete in the World Youth River Fly Fishing Championships.

Lydia Thomas, 17, from Maiden Newton is the only female in the Angling Trust's England under-18 Rivers Squad, and is heading to Idaho Falls.

The teenager, who is studying for her A-levels, has been fly and lure fishing since she was 11 years old.

She said she had never fished outside of the UK and it would be her first time travelling abroad.

Lydia, who has been in the squad for six months, said she got hooked on fishing thanks to her father, David.

She said: ""Mum took me to Sutton Bingham where he was fishing and I would sit underneath him, watching the line over my head.""

Mr Thomas said he would be travelling to Idaho with his daughter, who has type 1 diabetes.

""I am going as her health supporter so she can concentrate on fishing and I can worry about her blood sugar levels,"" he said.

""We've never been abroad and, with the heat, that will affect her blood sugars so it's all a bit unknown.

""I don't fish any more, I watch Lydia, that's where my enjoyment is.

""She's taken it to the next level.""

More than one tonne of fishing gear to be recycled,"An appeal to collect fishing gear at the end of its useable life saw more than one tonne of equipment dropped off at a dock.

East Suffolk Council held the four-day appeal at Hamilton Dock in Lowestoft to try to prevent redundant tackle from damaging the environment.

Members of the commercial fishing fleet dropped off a total of 1,194kg of items including nets, ropes, plastic pots and fish crates - the gill nets contained the equivalent of several kilometres of filament, line and rope.

Sally Noble, cabinet member for the environment, said it was ""such a reassurance to see so much material recovered through this project"" as discarded equipment could easily trap and entangle marine life.

The exercise was in collaboration with organisations belonging to the Eastern and Southern Plastics Coalition (ESPC), including the Eastern Inshore Fisheries Conservation Authority (IFCA), Keep Britain Tidy and energy firm RWE.

The aim of the exercise was to target abandoned fishing gear encountered and recovered by crews while out at sea. 

The nets which were collected will now be sent off to be shred, the pellets will be used to make new products and ropes will be re-processed and turned into composite mixed plastic board.

Noble, a Green councillor, said there was reassurance this discarded fishing gear would not enter the marine environment, even by accident.

She said: ""The commercial fishing community have really embraced this campaign and done their bit for a healthy marine environment by bringing along old fishing gear for free disposal.

""The great majority of our local fishing fleet take responsibility for managing their end-of-life gear, and I would like to thank everyone who took part.""

Another appeal is planned for a different location on the Suffolk coastline for the autumn, with a date yet to be announced. ",Fishing
Fishing retreat 'helps men with cancer to open up',"A group which aims to help men with cancer by teaching them fly-fishing is hosting its second weekend retreat in the UK.

Reel Recovery started in the US in 2003 and says it has helped more than 4,700 men living with cancer.

This weekend's event near Dereham, in Norfolk, will teach 12 men how to fly-fish while prompting conversations and offering a space for sharing their experiences of the disease.

The organiser, Michael Sayers, said men were ""notoriously bad"" at talking about health and emotions and the fishing trip ""really helps them to open up and think about how cancer has affected their lives and relationships and how they view their future"".

The retreat is free to participants and provides meals and accommodation at the location in North Elmham.

""Fly-fishing is basically like meditation in motion,"" said Mr Sayers.

""You're out there and you're literally immersed in nature or immersed in a river and you have the sound of the water flowing by and rustling the trees, no wifi, no interruptions and it's a simple, mindful, rhythmic act of casting a fly line.""

Reel Recovery ran its first retreat in the UK in Northumberland last year and it has worked with the Big C Cancer Charity and the Norfolk & Norwich University Hospital to organise this one.

Comedians Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse have fished in Norfolk with their BBC TV programme, Mortimer & Whitehouse: Gone Fishing where they share personal experiences of life, and Mortimer's experience of heart problems, while fishing.

Mr Sayers said the Reel Recovery activities were ""cathartic"" and offered men some escape as well.

During the weekend, a ceremony is held, where each man receives a fishing vest which has been passed down from each retreat.

""We have fishing vests which go back 22 years from when Reel Recovery started this programme in the United States and we get every participant to sign and date it and write a message on it,"" he said.

""Some of them will be wearing vests that would have had 22 years of [being worn by] other guys with cancer.

""There's a real feeling of strength that comes from that, and brotherhood."" ",Fishing
Man finds WW2 grenade while fishing with children,"A member of the public discovered a suspected World War Two hand grenade while magnet fishing in a river with his children.

David Lacey was treasure hunting with his children, aged five and eight, in the River Avon near the Five Rivers Leisure Centre in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday.

Wiltshire Police set up a cordon in the area surrounding the leisure centre and nearby residents were evacuated as a precaution.

The device, thought to be a Mills bomb, was later safely removed by a specialist Explosive Ordnance Disposal team and disposed of in a controlled burn at the Avon Valley Nature Reserve. 

Mr Lacey, who has been magnet fishing every Sunday for several months, says this is the first munition he has ever pulled from the murky water.

""Straight away I knew what it was,"" he said.

""I called the police and stopped people from coming too close. I also dropped it in a bucket of water to try and lessen the explosion, just in case it went off.""

The 46-year-old said he could see the safety pin had crumbled away after spending at least 80 years rusting on the silty riverbed. 

Mr Lacey said his young children were initially scared of the device, but soon became fascinated and ""excited"" by it.

""It's not the first one that's been found in the area, and I don't think it will be the last,"" he said.

He added his five-year-old son had also been tasked with looking after the school's plushie toy that weekend, which they returned with ""a story that no other parent is going to beat"". ",Fishing
Big octopus catch 'does fishing industry a favour',"A massive haul of Mediterranean octopus has helped a Cornish trawler land a catch worth a record £158,000.

The Newlyn-based beam trawler Enterprise was fishing close to the Channel Islands when its crew made the huge catch, a port record in terms of value, crew members said.

About 90% of the catch, some £142,000-worth, was the octopus, which has seen its population explode in UK waters this year.

The influx has caused problems for the shellfish industry in south-west England because octopus eat crabs and lobsters out of fishing pots. Enterprise skipper George Stevens said he had ""done the industry a favour"" by getting rid of a few.

The 42m (138ft) beam trawler was fishing in an area off the Channel Islands known as the Mare Deep when its nets were filled to bursting with nearly 20 tonnes of octopus.

Skipper George Stevens, who has been at the helm for the last 12 months, said: ""The figures were adding up in my head and I thought: 'This is going to be a good payday'.

""I rang one of the crew while he was in the supermarket to tell him how much money I'd just put in his account. I imagine the staff saw some strange reactions.

""The unfortunate thing is that it's been affecting the shellfish industry really badly. But one man's famine is another man's feast and, by getting rid of a few, we've done the industry a favour.""

Last month, shellfish fishermen in Devon complained an ""invasion"" of octopus was ""decimating"" the industry.

It is thought the octopus is coming from Morocco, as fishermen there are reporting a shortage of the creatures.

Dr Emma Sheehan, associate professor of marine ecology at the University of Plymouth, said there were ""a few possibilities"" for octopus appearing in such large numbers.

She said: ""Octopuses might be moving into the area because conditions have improved, perhaps due to better food availability or improved habitat quality from better environmental management.

""Another factor could be higher survival rates, especially in early life stages, possibly due to milder winters. Reduced fishing pressure may also be playing a role.""

It is not the first time the Enterprise has set a port record for Newlyn - it held the previous record for the biggest haul of £87,000 in 2022.

Mr Stevens said processing the huge catch presented its own challenges.

He said: ""These octopus have very big tentacles and they're very grippy.

""My crew only have two arms each and these have eight legs. It was quite entertaining to watch them try to peel them off their bodies.

""They're very fast-moving, were climbing down the elevator, climbing over the bins and up the walls.

""But once they went down to the fish room and touched a bit of ice, they became a bit more sedate.""

Paul Trebilcock is the manging director of W Stevenson & Sons Ltd, which owns the vessel.

He said: ""The catch was processed at Newlyn fish market and bought by one of the largest suppliers in the South West, Ocean Fish based in Roche, and then the vast majority was exported to Spain, Italy and France.

""We don't see it much in restaurants here. But, who knows, this is a new fishery for us, so maybe in the future we'll see it on plenty of restaurant menus."" ",Fishing
Fallen tree on tracks disrupts trains,"A fallen tree halted trains between Cosham and Southampton Central and Eastleigh.

Passengers face further wait for new trains,"New trains connecting Derby, Nottingham, Leicester and Sheffield with London are facing more delays before they are introduced.

East Midlands Railway's fleet of Class 810 Aurora trains were originally meant to enter service in 2022 but have yet to be used by passengers.

The new trains, which can run using diesel or electric power, have reportedly faced a series of teething problems during testing, with the latest delay initially reported by Rail Magazine.

The firm had previously hoped passengers would see the trains in service from May 2025 but now merely says it is committed to starting the introduction of the Class 810 trains on its Intercity route ""as soon as possible"".

East Midlands Railway's new Intercity fleet of 33 five-carriage trains is being built by Hitachi Rail in County Durham.

They were ordered to replace diesel trains introduced in 2004 and will run off electric power from overhead lines between London St Pancras and a junction to the south of Leicester.

Diesel engines will power the trains elsewhere on the network.

The Class 810 units are similar to existing trains running on the East Coast and Great Western main lines and promise improved features for passengers including more seats, fresh, modern interiors, air conditioning, free WiFi, plug sockets and better passenger information screens.

The first trains delivered to the operator have been undergoing testing on the UK rail network.

Freelance transport writer Pip Dunn says East Midlands Railway (EMR) is not alone in experiencing teething problems with its new trains.

""The delays of the Class 810s is just another in a long line of new trains failing to enter traffic on a date even close to their intended introduction,"" he said, adding the delay could have a serious knock-on effect.

""In this case, there is the added issue that some of the Class 222 trains EMR is due to return to their leasing company have already been earmarked for another user, so it is inevitable that one operator is going to be short of the number of trains it needs to fulfil their timetables.""

In a statement, EMR told the BBC it was working to bring the new trains into service as soon as possible.

""Testing and validation of the units has commenced and will continue over the summer,"" it said.

""Following this, we will be able to accept units and begin to train our drivers and train crews"".

A spokesman added: ""We remain committed to starting the introduction of the Class 810 trains on our Intercity route as soon as possible, with a phased roll-out during 2026.

""In parallel, we are working closely with industry partners to ensure service continuity and minimise the impact on passengers whilst we transition to our new trains"".",Trains
Leaks pulled new Metro trains from service,"A number of new Tyne and Wear Metro trains were withdrawn from service due to water leaks, operator Nexus has confirmed.

It said faults with heating, ventilation and air conditioning units caused the problems on Saturday, which the BBC understands affected four trains.

A joint investigation is being carried out with Swiss-manufacturer Stadler. It is understood all but one of the six new models available to passengers are back in service.

Nexus said the introduction of the new £362m fleet was the most ""complicated and challenging in its history"" and apologised to customers.

It comes after five of the fleet were pulled in April while a problem with doors was fixed.
More trains due

Nexus managing director Cathy Massarella and Lucius Gerig, CEO of Stadler Switzerland, said the issues over the last few days, which saw water leak into the carriages, were being investigated.

Both said they were working together to rectify any problems as ""quickly as possible.""

""We'd like to apologise to anyone who have been affected by this"", a joint statement said.

""Please be assured that we are doing everything we can to maintain a good service for customers.

""The fleet introduction is the biggest and most complex project in the history of the Tyne and Wear Metro and the current phase is the most challenging of any fleet transition project.""

They added they were taking ""a careful and phased approach"" to introducing the new trains, which will eventually replace the old fleet that has been operating for more than 40 years ago.

The first of the new trains made its maiden journey in December, with a series of delays meaning the original target date of summer 2023 was missed.

It is hoped that all 46 of the new trains will be in use by the end of 2026, with half due by the end of this year.",Trains

GWR battery-powered trains could be used in future,"Battery-powered trains could be used more frequently after a successful trial by Great Western Railway (GWR).

The rail company says using former underground trains and a rapid-charging system has shown the technology could replace its existing diesel fleet.

The year-long trial was held in west London but the trains will eventually be rolled out in the Thames Valley.

GWR says it can now prove the concept works and hopes to take the initiative to government.

GWR's railway franchise includes the west and south west of England, as well as routes between London and Didcot, Oxford, Reading and Windsor.

The trains use an onboard FastCharge battery that delivers the equivalent of a full charge for a car in 85 seconds.

Engineering director Simon Green said: ""...we are at a position where we understand how the technology works, the fact the technology can work in many different contexts as well.

""Going forward, we think it's a viable technology for application across wider parts of the Great Western network and the national UK rail network as well.""

The rapid charging system works by installing huge trackside batteries, which are cheaper than fitting overhead wires.

When the train pulls into the station, two shoes are extended to live rails between the tracks, topping up the onboard batteries.

An executive summary of the trial from GWR said: ""The success of the trial allows GWR to look more confidently at a future without diesel, providing alternative options that are cheaper to deliver while achieving the common goal of a cleaner, greener railway.""

Model trains and boats among items stolen from home,"Model boats and two vintage motorbikes were among the collectors' items and family heirlooms stolen from the home of an engineering enthusiast in his 90s.

Thames Valley Police said thieves took various possessions from a home on Netherton Road, in Abingdon, on 4 May.

Also among the items stolen were model steam trains and other antiques.

The son of the victim, who wishes to remain anonymous, urged the public to ""please help us to recover his treasured belongings"".

Det Con Laura Oakes said: ""We're appealing to anybody who has any knowledge of the whereabouts of this property to please come forward with information to help return them to the family.""

Police said the vintage motorbikes were believed to have been advertised for sale online in the Oxfordshire area since the theft.

""It is believed the motorcycles were advertised for sale in May, so we would urge anybody with information about the sale of the purchase of them to contact police,"" Det Con Oakes said.

The victim's son said: ""Our father is over 90-years-old. He served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and later worked at the Pressed Steel in Cowley, designing mechanical parts of cars.

New Piccadilly line trains delayed by up to a year,"New Piccadilly line trains will now be introduced up to a year later than planned.

The 94 fully walk-through trains with air-conditioning and CCTV had been pencilled in for passenger use in late 2025.

Transport for London (TfL) confirmed that this was now scheduled to happen in the second half of 2026.

Testing for the trains will begin this summer, TfL said. The new-generation trains will replace the existing 1970s fleet. 

The new trains will be lighter and more environmentally friendly, with real-time displays and wider doorways. The model is being described as the ""most complex"" train ever to be introduced to the Tube network.

TfL said some of the engineering challenges were down to the Piccadilly line being one of the longest and deepest Tube lines.

The network added that the engineering complexities had been more challenging than expected, which had caused the delay to the rollout.

Siemens Mobility and TfL said it would take up to a year to test the trains, which is partly due to the tunnel infrastructure on a rail line that is nearly 120 years old.

Sambit Banerjee, Joint CEO at Siemens Mobility, said: ""We're sorry we can't have our innovative trains running for passengers even sooner but, once they're in service, the technology on these new trains will bring smoother, greener and more comfortable journeys for Londoners for the next 30 or more years.""",Trains
Trains steam back into town after 30-year campaign,"Heritage railway bosses say there is still more work to do after a decades-long campaign saw passenger trains returning to a town.

Jack Ilcyszyn, assistant general manager of the Churnet Valley Railway in Staffordshire, said he had not even been born when the idea of restoring the line to Leek was first suggested.

The heritage railway organisation has not always had a smooth ride, however, with a number of issues to navigate to get to this latest success, extending their existing track from Leekbrook into the town.

There also remains outstanding the not-inconsiderable issue of a station still to be built – the site of the original Leek Railway Station is now home to a Morrisons supermarket.

The last mainline passenger service into Leek from Uttoxeter was on 4 January 1965, according to the the railway's website, with goods traffic ending in July 1970.

Mr Ilcyszyn said the project really got under way at the end of 2019, supported with a grant of £1.4m of European funding.

It became stalled by the Covid pandemic and had been ""an uphill battle"" ever since, according to Mr Ilcyszyn.

After lockdown restrictions were lifted, planning permission for the scheme lapsed.

""We had all the materials, all the site, all the contracts signed but we now didn't have the planning application,"" Mr Ilcyszyn said.

Once planning approval was approved again, towards the end of 2022 further issues arose as they began laying track, due to sewage pipes running underground parallel to the planned railway line.

They were forced to change their original plans, extending the embankment further to one side to give extra space between the track and the pipework.

Mr Ilcyzsyn said this added about £500,000 to the project's costs and, overall, the scheme fell about a year and a half behind schedule.

But with the last rail laid, the first train ran along the newly extended section of railway on 31 December 2024, just in time to meet their funding deadline.

However, the project did also face political headwinds with a change in leadership at Staffordshire Moorlands District Council Mr Ilcyszyn said, with a new administration which he claimed was not supportive of the railway.

But the council's leader, Mike Gledhill, said the new section of railway was a valuable part of the area's tourism strategy.

""Churnet Valley Railway's extension to Leekbrook is a significant and welcomed development,"" he said.

He added there had been recent contact about possible future funding opportunities.

Extending the line cost about £1.8m so far but there are still plans by the group to build a new station and car parking facilities.

Taking the railway to Leek brings the added benefit, the organisation said, of connecting with existing amenities within the town, which are not available at other stops along the line.

Trains currently run to Leek during the railway's Steam Heritage Open Days.

The remaining journeys into Leek this year will take place on 27 September and 18 October, Mr Ilcyszyn added.",Trains
Reduced timetable as new DLR trains delayed,"Newly built Docklands Light Railway (DLR) trains that were due to be introduced in April 2024 will not be ready until later this year, leading to a temporary reduction in services.

A fifth of its 90 trains, some of which have been operating since the early 1990s, are being retired this summer. By the end of next year, there should be 54 new trains.

The Transport for London (TfL) commissioner's report for June states it is ""rectifying the signalling issues"" discovered during testing last year.

Stuart Harvey, TfL's chief capital officer, said: ""We apologise for any inconvenience to customers but these changes are necessary to ensure we can maintain the most reliable service possible.""

TfL hopes to introduce the 54 new trains and replace the oldest 33 in its fleet by the end of 2026.

Mr Harvey added: ""Testing of the new DLR trains - which will significantly improve frequency, reliability and customer experience across the network - is now well advanced and we will soon commence reliability runs.

""We are working very closely with our supply chain to complete the final activities prior to bringing them into passenger service, and remain on track to introduce the first new trains later this year.

""To extend the life of the old trains they are replacing, there will be some short-term timetable changes to reduce mileage.""",Trains
Union claims trains are 'disrupted' for rugby fans,"A union has claimed there will be ""severe disruption"" for Hull rugby fans travelling via train to Wembley.

The Challenge Cup Final with Hull Kingston Rovers facing Warrington Wolves takes place in London on Saturday.

Train drivers' union Aslef which has been involved in a long-running dispute with Hull Trains, said industrial action would force the operator to cancel services.

Hull Trains said that ""minor alterations"" were in place on Friday due to the industrial action with 80% of its services running.

The union claimed a driver was unfairly dismissed for raising a safety concern, which the company denies.
