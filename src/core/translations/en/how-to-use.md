## Create a corpus (your dataset)
        
This tool will analyze a corpus (a dataset) of text documents.
Each document is simply a bit of text that you found on the web (or elsewhere).
It can be as short as a sentence, or as long as a newspaper article.
But it has to be just text (no images or other media).
