## 1. Create a corpus (dataset)
        
This tool will analyze a corpus (a dataset) of text documents.
Each document is simply a bit of text that you found on the web (or elsewhere).
It can be as short as a sentence, or as long as a newspaper article.
But it has to be just text (no images or other media).

First, let's see how it works, then we will see where to find documents and how to select them.

#### How to get started

Click on "Get started" in the menu to load the "Documents" page.

**If you just want to see the tool in action**, load an example from the menu at the bottom of the screen.

**If you want to make your own corpus**, then click on "Add document" to start editing your first document.

This will open an interface to edit your first document.

A document consists of three parts:

1. A title
2. Textual content
3. A category

#### How to fill a document

Let's assume that you have a source of information, like a Wikipedia page, to use as a document.

* **First, give a title.** You can invent it, or reuse your source's title (if it has one). It is just a way to identify your document easily. Type it in the top field of the interface.
* **Second, copy-paste the textual content of your source** into the middle field of the interface.
* **Third, type a category** in the bottom field. *Be consistent in your spelling, or else each different spelling will count as a different category.* We explain how to decide categories down below.

Once you have filled all three parts, you can save your document by clicking on the "Save" button. *Note that you cannot save your document if it is not complete.*

#### How to manage the dataset

You can create as many documents as you want.

We think you need at least 10 documents, but 20 is a better number. You could go up to 50, or more if your computer is powerful (it will take more time to compute).

**Click on a saved to enter edit mode again.** You can change it, or even delete it. Remember to save (or cancel) your changes.

You can **save your dataset** by clicking on the "Save (CSV)" button. You will be able to upload it later on, or share it with other people.

**Once you are ready... TODO**
