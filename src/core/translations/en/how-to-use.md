## Create a corpus (dataset)
        
This tool will analyze a corpus (a dataset) of text documents.
Each document is simply a bit of text that you found on the web (or elsewhere).
It can be as short as a sentence, or as long as a newspaper article.
But it has to be just text (no images or other media).

First, let's see how it works, then we will see where to find documents and how to select them.

Click on "Get started" in the menu to load the "Documents" page, then click on "Add document" to start editing your first document.

This will open an interface to edit your first document.

A document consists of three parts:

1. A title
2. Textual content
3. A category

#### How to fill a document

Let's assume that you have a source of information, like a Wikipedia page, to use as a document.

* **First, give a title to your document.** You can invent it, or reuse the title of your source if it has one. The title is just a way to identify your document easily. Type it in the top field of the interface.
* **Second, copy-paste the textual content of your source** into the middle field of the interface.
* **Third, type a category** in the bottom field. Be consistent in your spelling, or else each different spelling will count as a different category. We will explain how to pick good categories later on.

Once you have filled all three parts, you can save your document by clicking on the "Save" button. *Note that you cannot save your document if it is not complete.*
